# Contributing

## App Platform Dev Mode

This mode is only required when developing enhancements/fixes to the core App
Platform code or the base HelloWorld Template. This will typically only be
performed by DSS developers as all changes to core platform code should be
committed to the dss-app-platform repo.

Any consumers of the App Platform who have feature requests / bug fixes,
should reach out via the
#TODO: Put in new url for github issues for project
[Issues](https://github.com/libertymutual/<app-name>/issues) to
have their changes incorporated.

If you do require running in "dev mode", see
[Platform Development Mode](/contributing/platform-development-mode.md)
instructions
