# Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to install the App Platform CLI and use it to generate a starter project.

1. Install the App Platform CLI

  ```sh
  npm install -g lmig--dss-app-platform
  ```

1. Create a new app using the CLI, replacing `MyNewApp` with the name of your project

  ```sh
  dss --project MyNewApp
  cd MyNewApp
  ```
