This is the recommended approach for most use cases.\nHowever if you require additional features, or if you wish to use a different technology (e.g. Cordova, ReactJS, Angular etc.) the instructions below outline the steps required to add an additional feature.\nNote: A \"Feature\" may contain 1 or more \"Modules\". However most Features will simply contain 1 module.\nFeatures are declared in the iOS Swift code, and in the app.json file (including defining their default/launch module). However by simply registering an additional item in the index.js file of the feature (e.g. /app/default/index.js) you can register additional components which can be navigated to directly. This could potentially be used for deep-linking etc. For clarity, it is recommended to define each module using the naming convention \"____Module\" (see /app/default/index.js for example)\nAdding a new Feature\nReact Native\nCommon Steps\n\nCopy the existing default/ folder from the app/ directory\nPaste the copy into the app/ directory and name the folder appropriately (e.g. \"example\")\nGo to the index.js file in your feature folder (e.g. /app/example/index.js) and replace DefaultModule with the new module name (e.g. ExampleModule)\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('DefaultModule', () => App); // old value\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('ExampleModule', () => App); // new value\n\n\nEdit the dss-app-template/common.js file and add a new line to import the newly added Module e.g.\nimport './app/example'\n\n\nEdit the dss-app-template/app.json file and add an additional entry to the features array. (Copy an existing feature entry) updating any values as necessary\n{\n \"name\": \"Example\",\n \"config\": {\"theme\": \"light\"},\n \"viewConfig\": {\n       \"name\": \"ReactNative\",\n       \"config\": {\n           \"bundleURL\": \"http://localhost:8081/index.ios.bundle?platform=ios\",\n           \"moduleName\": \"ExampleModule\",\n           \"initialProperties\": {\"hello\": \"I'm an initial property\"},\n           \"launchOptions\": null\n       }\n   }\n}\n\n\n\niOS Steps\n\nOpen the dss-app-template/ios project in XCode\nExpand the HelloWorld/Features group in Xcode\nCreate a new Group called Example (or applicable)\nCreate a new file within this Group called ExampleFeature.swift (or applicable)\nCopy-Paste the contents of an existing feature (e.g. DefaultFeature.swift)\nUpdate the following values in your newly created Swift file\nReplace DefaultFeature with ExampleFeature (or applicable)class DefaultFeature: ReactNativeFeature, Feature   // current\nclass ExampleFeature: ReactNativeFeature, Feature   // new value\n\n\nReplace \"Default\" with \"Example\" (or applicable)var name: String = \"Default\"  // current\nvar name: String = \"Example\"  // new value\n\n\n\n\nOpen AppDelegate.swift\n\nAdd a new line to initialize the new Feature e.g.\nlet exampleFeature = ExampleFeature(config: nil)\n\n\nAdd the new feature to the FeatureManager initialization e.g.\nlet featureManager = FeatureManager(features: [defaultFeature, secondFeature, \n  exampleFeature], defaultFeature: \"Default\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Steps\n\nAll set! You may now begin editing your React Native app located in dss-app-template/app/example\n(Don't forget to run react-native start from the dss-app-template folder first)\n\n\nNote: If you wish to make your new feature the default/launch feature then update the following:\nEdit the \"defaultFeature attribute in the following line in AppDelegate.swiftlet featureManager = FeatureManager(features: [defaultFeature, secondFeature, \n  exampleFeature], defaultFeature: \"Default\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCordova\nNot yet implemented\nProject structure\n-- app/\n  |-- default # The default app feature, using React Native\n  |-- second  # The second app feature, using React Native\n\n"},"project-structure.html":{"url":"project-structure.html","title":"Project Structure","keywords":"","body":"Project Structure\nYOUR_APP/\n    __tests__/        # React Native unit tests\n    android/          # Android files\n    app/              # React Native project code\n    ios/              # iOS files\n    www/              # Cordova root\n    common.js         # Common imports for both iOS and Android\n    index.ios.js      # React Native's iOS entry point\n    index.android.js  # React Native's Android entry point\n    app.json          # Project file\n\n"},"contributing/":{"url":"contributing/","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nApp Platform Dev Mode\nThis mode is only required when developing enhancements/fixes to the core App\nPlatform code or the base HelloWorld Template.

These standards / processes should be\nfollowed at all times, and all requirements must be met before submitting a pull\nrequest to merge code into the main develop branch.\nPlease be pro-active in addressing any code which you spot which does not\nsatisfy the below requirements, or any areas which may have missing unit tests.\nOur code quality is a collective team effort, so if you spot missing unit tests,\nplease add them...even if you did not add the file in the first place.\nOur build pipeline has been configured to fail any builds which do not satisfy\nsome of the requirements listed below. If you merge code which fails a build,\naddressing this broken build should become your first priority, taking\nprecedence over any other project work.\nCommon Standards\nAny changes to code in this repository should adhere to the common standards\nlisted in this section. There are some additional standards listed that are\nspecific to a certain language/framework.\nCode Review\nAll code must be reviewed by a senior peer before code is merged to develop. No\ncode should be pushed directly to develop, master or release branches\n\n This can be done using Bitbucket's built in\npull request\ntool\n\nUnit Tests\nAll existing unit tests must pass\n\nBuild is configured to fail if unit test coverage drops below a specified\nthreshold or if unit tests fail\nAny new functionality should include unit tests\nThis applies to new files added, but also to new functionality added to\nexisting files\n\n\nUnit testing should not simply be a simple 'ComponentX renders correctly' test\n(even if this alone results in a high unit test coverage)\nUnit tests should test real functionality, business logic, functions & rules\n\nCode Comments\nAll code should be commented where appropriate, especially code that may not be\nimmediately obvious\nIn the future, we may adopt formal code comments (e.g. JSDoc)\nReact Native\nLint\nThis project uses ESLint to manage linting\n\nAll code must pass the eslint code quality tool and zero lint errors should be\npresent.\nThe build is configured to fail if lint errors are detected.\nAny changes to .eslintrc should be reviewed by a tech lead\nRun the linter using npm run lint\n\n\n Most IDE's have an extension or plugin that allows real-time\nlint checking\n\nFlow\nBecause javascript is dynamically typed, the App Manager platform uses\nFlow for static type checking. All code must pass the flow\ncode quality tool and zero flow errors should be present.\n\nRun npm run flow to execute\nIt is recommended that you configure your IDE to enable real-time flow\nchecking for instant feedback\nAny changes to .flowrc should be reviewed by a tech lead\nThe build is configured to fail if there are any flow errors\nAll new JS files must have the // @flow declaration at the top of the file\nThis applies to all .js files including index.js and styles.js files\nBuild is configured to fail if lint errors are detected\n\n\n\nUnit Testing with Jest\nThe React Native code uses Jest as its unit testing framework\n\nRun npm run test to execute\nRun npm run update-snapshots to update Jest Snapshots\n\n\n Note: Snapshots should not be updated blindly just to get tests\npassing. It is easy to blindly update these with incorrect snapshot data. All\nsnapshot changes you commit should be manually reviewed by yourself, and\nshould also be reviewed by the person completing your PR approval\n\nIndex Exports\nAny new files should be properly exported from an index.js file within the same\ndirectory\niOS Native Code\nLinting with SwiftLint\nAll code must pass the SwiftLint code quality tool and zero lint errors should\nbe present\n\nAny changes to .swiftlint.yml should be reviewed by tech lead\nBuild is configured to fail if lint errors are detected\n\nAndroid Native Code\nSee the common standards\n"}}}
